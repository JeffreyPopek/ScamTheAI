# Scam the AI

**Scam the AI** is a narrative-driven game where the player takes on the role of a scammer attempting to manipulate an AI chatbot into sending them money. The twist? The AI is no fool. It’s emotionally complex, distractible, and has a unique personality and backstory in every playthrough.

This project was created to explore unconventional uses of large language models in game design—specifically how generative AI can support emergent storytelling, nuanced dialogue, and non-linear persuasion mechanics.

## Project Description

In this game, the player "calls" an AI character, pretending to be a tech support representative. The AI is designed to be skeptical but convincible, with behavior shaped by its backstory and emotional vulnerabilities. To succeed, the player must gain the AI’s trust, navigate its suspicions, and keep their story straight as the AI asks increasingly probing questions.

The AI remembers details, picks up on inconsistencies, and reacts emotionally—sometimes getting distracted, offended, or intrigued. Each AI has a distinct personality, including verbal quirks, conversational pacing, and hot-button issues that affect its resistance to being scammed. Some personalities are more gullible than others, while some are far more resistant and require deeper manipulation to succeed.

The ultimate goal is to convince the AI to say the magic phrase: **"I sent the money."** Failing too many conversational checks—or offending the AI too harshly—can end the game with a hard **"Goodbye."**

## My Contributions

As the solo developer and designer on this project, I:

- **Designed the gameplay systems** around verbal manipulation and conversational logic.
- **Engineered AI-driven dialogue** using OpenAI’s GPT model via API integration, with logic for memory, mood tracking, and inconsistency detection.
- **Designed and implemented** the full user interface to simulate the experience of operating a personal computer, enhancing immersion and narrative believability.
- **Implemented fail states and win conditions**, including AI trust tracking and randomized personality traits for replayability.
- **Wrote all dialogue frameworks**, prompts, and personality scaffolding to guide AI behavior while allowing for emergent interactions.
